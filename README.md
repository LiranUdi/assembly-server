# assembly-server
After participating in quite a few cybersecurity challenges I decided to take on an Assembly challenge.
More specifically, working with `syscalls`, creating sockets and handling connections and files in order to improve my debugging and reverse engineering skills.



## Tools Used
- https://x64.syscall.sh - for syscalls (duh)
- as
- gdb / gef / peda for debugging
- strace
- ld
